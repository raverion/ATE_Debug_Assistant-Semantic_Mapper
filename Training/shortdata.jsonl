Based on the names of th two output variables, i_leakDS and i_leak100mA_DS, as well as the name of ATE pins LX2 and SW2 that are being referenced in the code, it is likely that the purpose of this piece of code is to test some kind of Drain-to-Source leakage currents in a switch-mode power-supply device (SMPS).

Here is a pseudocode explaining the test sequence:
   - Forces 12V on SW2 pin
   - Configures measurement settings of LX2 pin (10 samples, 5.1us intervals)
   - Forces 0V on LX2 pin at 50uA current clamps, then waits for 15ms
   - Measures current on LX2 pin and passes the value to i_leakDS
   - Forces 12V on LX2 pin, then waits for 5ms
   - Measures current on LX2 pin again and pass the value to i_leak100mA_DS
   - Resets LX2 pin and SW2 pin to 0V, carefully gates off and disconnects to prevent spikes.
